# RGCs-classification

Classification of Retinal Ganglion Cell based on gene expression 

This repository contains the semester team project for the Data Science & Information Technologies masters course: Machine Learning in Computational Biology  at the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens (NKUA) during the Spring 2023 semester.
## Introduction
The present study introduces a comprehensive classification pipeline for the analysis of single-cell gene
expression profiles. By utilizing single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data obtained from the primary
research article, our objective was to investigate the diversity within cell populations and ascertain the
crucial characteristics that influence the classification procedure. The methodology employed in this study
included several essential stages, which involved the exploration and preprocessing of data, the selection
of relevant features, the fine-tuning of hyperparameters, and the implementation of classification using
multiple classifiers.

The data for the analysis were taken from:  [Daniszewski M, Senabouth A, Nguyen QH, et al. Single cell RNA sequencing of stem cell-derivedretinal ganglion cells. Scientific Data. 2018 Feb;5:180013. DOI: 10.1038/sdata.2018.13. PMID: 29437159;
PMCID: PMC5810423] (https://europepmc.org/article/MED/29437159)
